# File structure

## The assets folder

The assets folder contains all the frontend code for the Cakefections project, including images, fonts, and all SCSS styling.

## The functions folder

The functions folder contains the major JavaScript functions running on the site that are linked to functions.php. These include acf.php, custom-post-types.php, and shortcodes.php.

## The partials folder

In addition to the functions folder, there are also three php files for smaller snippets of code for better readability and organization. These are broken up into loop.php, pagination.php, and searchform.php.

# JavaScript

JavaScript code can be found in the functions folder and partials folder.
