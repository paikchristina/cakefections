    <p class="aboutbody">Started in 1936, Cakefections is a classic American bakery, featuring breads, doughnuts, cookies and pastries that are proudly baked each day. The bakery is nestled in Naperville, on the corner of Foxcroft and Washington.</p>

    <p class="aboutbody">At Cakefections, each doughnut is hand cut and finished, each loaf of bread is hand formed and everything is baked with the hopes of bringing a little bit of joy and goodness to someone's day.</p>

    <p class="aboutbody">Start your day right with a latte and a golden, perfectly glazed apple fritter or pick up a selection of nutty, sweet butter pecan cookies â€“ the perfect finish for a week-day dinner.</p>
